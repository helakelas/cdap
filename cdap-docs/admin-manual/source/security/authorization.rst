=============
Authorization
=============

Authorization allows users to enforce fine-grained access control on CDAP entities:
namespaces, artifacts, applications, programs, datasets, streams, and secure keys. All
operations on these entities |---| listing, viewing, creating, updating, managing,
deleting |---| are governed by authorization policies.

.. _security-enabling-authorization:

Enabling Authorization
======================
To enable authorization in :term:`Distributed CDAP <distributed cdap>`, add these
properties to :ref:`cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-default-security>`:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Value
   * - ``security.authorization.enabled``
     -  true
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.jar.path``
     - Absolute path of the JAR file to be used as the authorization extension. This file
       must be present on the local file system of the CDAP Master. In an HA environment, it
       should be present on the local file system of all CDAP Master hosts.
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.extra.classpath`` (Optional)
     - Extra classpath for security extension

Authorization in CDAP only takes effect once :ref:`perimeter security
<admin-perimeter-security>` is also enabled by setting ``security.enabled`` to ``true``.
Additionally, Kerberos must be enabled on the cluster and for CDAP by setting
``kerberos.auth.enabled`` to ``true`` since CDAP Authorization depends on Kerberos.

These additional properties can also be optionally modified to configure authorization:

- ``security.authorization.cache.max.entries``
- ``security.authorization.cache.ttl.secs``

Please refer to :ref:`cdap-defaults.xml <appendix-cdap-default-security>` for
documentation on these configuration settings.

Authorization in CDAP is implemented as :ref:`authorization extensions
<authorization-extensions>`. Apart from the above configuration settings, an extension may
require additional properties to be configured. Please see the documentation on
individual extensions for configuring properties specific to that extension:

- :ref:`Integrations: Apache Sentry <apache-sentry>`
- `Integrations: Apache Ranger <https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-security-extn/wiki/CDAP-Ranger-Extension>`_

:ref:`Security extension properties <appendix-cdap-default-security>`, which are specified
in ``cdap-site.xml``, begin with the prefix ``security.authorization.extension.config``.

When CDAP is first started with authorization enabled, no users are granted privileges on
any CDAP entities. Without any privileges, CDAP will not be able to create the default namespace.
To create the default namespace, grant *ADMIN* on default namespace to the CDAP master user.
The default namespace will get created in several minutes automatically.


.. _security-authorization-policies:

Authorization Policies
======================
Currently, CDAP allows users to enforce authorization for *READ*, *WRITE*, *EXECUTE*, and
*ADMIN* operations.

In general, this summarizes the authorization policies in CDAP:

- A **create** operation on an entity requires *ADMIN* on the entity. The *ADMIN* privilege needs to be granted before
  the entity can be created. For example, creating a namespace requires *ADMIN* on the namespace.
- A **read** operation (such as reading from a dataset or a stream) on an entity requires
  *READ* on the entity.
- A **write** operation (such as writing to a dataset or a stream) on an entity requires
  *WRITE* on the entity.
- An **admin** operation (such as setting properties) on an entity requires *ADMIN* on
  the entity.
- A **delete** operation on an entity requires *ADMIN* on the entity. Note that if the deletion operation will delete
  multiple entities, *ADMIN* is required on all the entities. For example, delete on a namespace requires *ADMIN* on
  all entities in the namespace, and the namespace itself.
- An **execute** operation on a program requires *EXECUTE* on the program.
- A **list** or **view** operation (such as listing or searching applications, datasets, streams,
  artifacts) only returns those entities that the logged-in user has at least one (*READ*,
  *WRITE*, *EXECUTE*, *ADMIN*) privilege on or on any of its descendants.
- A **get** operation on an entity (such as getting the dataset property, app detail) only succeeds if the user has
  at least one (*READ*, *WRITE*, *EXECUTE*, *ADMIN*) privilege on it or any of its descendants.
- Only admins of the authorization backend can grant or revoke the privileges.

Additionally:

- Upon successful creation/deletion of an entity, the privileges remain unaffected.
  It is the responsibility of the administrator to delete privileges from the authorization backend on entity deletion.
  If the privileges are not deleted and the entity is recreated, the old privileges will be retained for the new entity
- CDAP does **not** support hierarchical authorization enforcement, which means that privileges on each entity
  are evaluated independently.

Authorization policies for various CDAP operations are listed in the following tables. Policies for more complex operations
can be checked :ref:`below <security-authorization-deploying-app>`.

.. _security-pre-grant-wildcard-privilege:

Wildcard Privileges
===================
Wildcard privileges can be used to minimize the burden of granting privileges on all entities.
Detailed ways of granting privileges can be found in the following sections for different authorization backends.

.. _security-sentry-integration:

Sentry Integration
------------------
:ref:`CDAP CLI <cdap-cli>` can be used to grant or revoke the privileges for :ref:`Integrations: Apache Sentry <apache-sentry>`.

You can use the :ref:`CDAP CLI <cdap-cli>` to issue :ref:`security commands <cli-available-commands-security>`.
Wildcard can be used to grant or revoke actions on multiple entities by including ``*`` and ``?`` in the entity name:

- To grant a principal privileges to perform certain actions on an entity, use::

    > grant actions <actions> on entity <entity-id> to <principal-type> <principal-name>
    > revoke actions <actions> on entity <entity-id> from <principal-type> <principal-name>

  where:

  - ``<actions>`` is a comma-separated list of privileges, any of *READ, WRITE, EXECUTE,* or *ADMIN*.

  - ``<entity>`` is of the form ``<entity-type>:<entity-id>``, where ``<entity-type>`` is
    one of ``namespace``, ``artifact``, ``application``, ``dataset``, ``program``, ``stream``, ``dataset_type`` or
    ``dataset_module``.

  - For namespaces, ``<entity-id>`` is composed from the namespace, such as
    ``namespace:<namespace-name>``.

  - For datasets, streams, artifacts and apps, ``<entity-id>`` is the namespace and entity names, such as
    ``<namespace-name>.<dataset-name>``, ``<namespace-name>.<stream-name>``, ``<namespace-name>.<artifact-name>``,
    and ``<namespace-name>.<app-name>``.

  - For programs, ``<entity-id>`` includes the application name and the program type:
    ``<namespace-name>.<app-name>.<program-type>.<program-name>``. ``<program-type>`` is
    one of flow, mapreduce, service, spark, worker, or workflow.

  - For datasets, streams, artifacts and apps, ``<entity-id>`` is the namespace and entity names, such as
    ``<namespace-name>.<dataset-name>``, ``<namespace-name>.<stream-name>``, ``<namespace-name>.<artifact-name>``,
    and ``<namespace-name>.<app-name>``.

  - ``<principal-type>`` can **only** be ``role`` since Sentry only supports granting privileges to roles.

  - Wildcard can be used in each entity name to grant privileges to multiple entities. For example,
    ``namespace:ns*`` represents all namespaces that starts with ``ns``.
    ``namespace:ns?`` represents all namespaces that starts with ``ns`` and follows by a single character.
    ``program:ns1.app1.*`` represents all types of programs in application app1 in namespace ns1.

- To add the role to other principal, use::

    > add role <role-name> to <principal-type> <principal-name>

  where:

  - ``<role-name>`` is the role name that adds to the principal.

  - ``<principal-type>`` can **only** be ``group``.

- To create a new role, use::

    > create role <role-name>

- To check the results, list the privileges for a principal::

    > list privileges for <principal-type> <principal-name>

For example,
to make ``alice``, in group ``admin``, as the administrator on a namespace ``ns1`` in a new environment,
do the following steps:

- create a new role ``ns1_administrator``

- use the commands to grant *ADMIN* on these entities: ``namespace:ns1``, ``application:ns1.*``, ``program:ns1.*.*``,
  ``artifact:ns1.*``, ``dataset:ns1.*``, ``stream:ns1.*``, ``dataset_type:ns1.*``, ``dataset_module:ns1.*``,
  ``securekey:ns1.*`` and ``kerberosprincipal.*`` to the role ``ns1_administrator``

- add ``ns1_administrator`` to group ``admin``

Note that:

- Only users in sentry admin group can be used to grant/revoke the privileges, this property can be set or updated by
  changing property ``sentry.service.admin.group`` in sentry.
- Since only sentry admin group can get roles from Sentry and then do enforce, the Sentry integration will by
  default use group *cdap* to issue the enforce call. It is highly recommended to have group *cdap* in the admin group.
  To use a different group, modify the value of ``security.authorization.extension.config.sentry.admin.group`` in CDAP. Note
  that this value must be in ``sentry.service.admin.group`` in sentry
- Any update to privileges will take some time to take effect based on the cache timeout. By default, the maximum
  time will be 10 minutes. This value can be changed by modifying the value of ``security.authorization.cache.ttl.secs`` in CDAP.

.. _security-ranger-integration:

Ranger Integration
------------------
To use Apache Ranger as the authorization backend, please refer to `CDAP Ranger Extension <https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-security-extn/wiki/CDAP-Ranger-Extension>`_


.. _security-authorization-policies-complex-operations:

Policy For Complex Operations
=============================
Some complex operations will require multiple privileges. For example, deploying an application can create streams and datasets.
In this case, privileges are required for all the entities that will get created. Wildcard policies will be helpful to
manage the privileges in these cases.

Detailed authorization policies for complex CDAP operations are listed below:

.. _security-authorization-deploying-app:

Deploy App
----------
The privileges required to deploy an application can vary based on various conditions. In general, the requesting user always
need *ADMIN* privilege on the application and some privilege on the artifact depending on the existence of the artifact.
The requesting user will need *ADMIN* privilege on datasets, dataset types and streams that will get created along with
the app if no impersonation is involved. If the app is impersonated as some other user, the requesting user will need
*ADMIN* privilege on the kerberos principal of that user and the impersonated user will need *ADMIN* privilege to create
datasets and streams. The following table shows the privileges needed under certain condition, note that the entity name
in the table can be replaced with * and ? to represent wildcard policy:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 50 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Condition
     - Privileges Required
     - Entity-id For Grant
   * - Always
     - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on the application
     - application:<namespace-name>.<application-name>
   * - Using new artifact
     - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on the artifact
     - artifact:<namespace-name>.<artfiact-name>
   * - Using existing artifact
     - Requesting user: Any privilege of *READ, WRITE, EXECUTE,* or *ADMIN* on the artifact
     - artifact:<namespace-name>.<artfiact-name>
   * - Creating datasets and streams without impersonation
     - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on the datasets and streams
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<dataset-name> and stream:<namespace>.<stream-name>
   * - Creating custom datasets without impersonation
     - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on the dataset modules and types
     - dataset_module:<namespace-name>.<dataset-module-name> and dataset_type:<namespace-name>.<dataset-type-name>
   * - Create impersonated application
     - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on the kerberos principal of the impersonated user
     - kerberosprincipal:<principal-name>
   * - Creating datasets and streams with impersonation
     - Impersonated user: *ADMIN* on the datasets and streams
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<dataset-name> and stream:<namespace>.<stream-name>
   * - Creating custom datasets with impersonation
     - Impersonated user: *ADMIN* on the dataset modules and types
     - dataset_module:<namespace-name>.<dataset-module-name> and dataset_type:<namespace-name>.<dataset-type-name>


.. _security-authorization-executing-programs:

Execute Programs/Hydrator Pipelines
-----------------------------------
To execute a program or a pipeline, the user will need *EXECUTE* privilege on it. If there is no impersonation, the program
will be running as CDAP master user. If impersonation is involved, the program will be running as the impersonated user.
In any case, the user who is running the program needs to have the corresponding privileges to access the all the streams
and datasets that will be used during program execution. The following table shows the privileges needed under certain condition,
note that the entity name in the table can be replaced with * and ? to represent wildcard policy:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 50 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Condition
     - Privileges Required
     - Entity-id For Grant
   * - Always
     - Requesting user: *EXECUTE* on the program
     - program:<namespace-name>.<app-name>.<program-type>.<program-name> or program:<namespace-name>.<app-name>.* for all
       programs in the application
   * - READ from existing streams and datasets
     - Program runner: *READ* on the streams and datasets
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<dataset-name> and stream:<namespace>.<stream-name>
   * - WRITE to existing streams and datasets
     - Program runner: *WRITE* on the streams and datasets
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<dataset-name> and stream:<namespace>.<stream-name>
   * - Creating datasets and read/write on the datasets:
     - Program runner: *ADMIN*, *READ*/*WRITE* on the datasets
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<dataset-name>
   * - Creating local datasets, *READ*/*WRITE* on local datasets
     - Program runner: *ADMIN*, *READ*/*WRITE* on local datasets, the run-id will be suffixed to the local dataset names,
       so wildcard policies will be needed.
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<local-dataset-name>*
   * - Accessing external source/sink, i.e, accessing datasets outside CDAP (only for hydrator pipelines)
     - Program runner: *ADMIN*, *READ* and *WRITE* on the external datasets. The name of the external datasets will be same
       as the reference name of the source/sink.
     - dataset:<namespace-name>.<reference-name>

.. _security-authorization-enable-dataprep:

Enable DataPrep Service
-----------------------
To enable the DataPrep service, these privileges are needed:
   - Requesting user: *EXECUTE* on entity ``program:<namespace-name>.dataprep.service.service``
   - Without impersonation:
       - Requesting user: *ADMIN* on entity ``dataset:<namespace-name>.workspace``, ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprep``,
         ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprepfs``, ``dataset_type:<namespace-name>.*WorkspaceDataset`` and
         ``dataset_module:<namespace-name>.*WorkspaceDataset``
       - CDAP master user: *READ*, *WRITE* on entity ``dataset:<namespace-name>.workspace``, ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprep`` and
         ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprepfs``
   - With impersonation:
       - Impersonated user: *ADMIN*, *READ* and *WRITE*  on entity ``dataset:<namespace-name>.workspace``, ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprep`` and
         ``dataset:<namespace-name>.dataprepfs``. *ADMIN* on ``dataset_type:<namespace-name>.*WorkspaceDataset`` and
         ``dataset_module:<namespace-name>.*WorkspaceDataset``


.. _security-differences-between-new-and-old-model:

Differences Between New and Old Model
=====================================
CDAP has migrated to the new auth model in 4.3 and old auth model will not work. The detailed new authorization policy
can be checked :ref:`above <security-authorization-policies>`.

In general, this summarizes the authorization policies change in CDAP:
   - No hierarchical authorization enforcement is supported, which means having a privilege on an entity's parent does
     not give that privilege on the entity. For example, having *READ* on the namespace does not give *READ* to
     the datasets and streams in the namespace.
   - No authorization bootstrap, no privileges on instance and no admin users. The new model removes the requirement
     of privileges on CDAP instance and admin users. Each privilege needs to be pre-granted to create the entity
     either through CDAP CLI or through an external interface of the supported authorization extension.
   - Automatic grant on entity creation and automatic revoke on entity deletion are removed. It is the responsibility
     of the administrator to create and delete privileges.


.. _security-auth-policy-pushdown:

Authorization Policy Pushdown
=============================
Currently, CDAP does not support the pushing of authorization policy grants and revokes to
:term:`storage providers <storage provider>`. As a result, when a user is granted *READ*
or *WRITE* access on existing datasets or streams, permissions are not updated in the
storage providers. The same applies when authorization policies are revoked.

A newly-applied authorization policy will be enforced when the dataset or stream is
accessed from CDAP, but not when it is accessed directly in the storage provider. If the
pushdown of permissions to storage providers is desired, it needs to be done manually.
This will be done automatically in a future release of CDAP.

This limitation has a larger implication when :ref:`Cross-namespace Dataset Access
<cross-namespace-dataset-access>` is used. When accessing a dataset from a different
namespace, CDAP currently presumes that the user accessing the dataset has been granted
permissions on the dataset in the storage provider prior to accessing the dataset from
CDAP.

For example, if a program in the namespace *ns1* tries to access a :term:`fileset` in the
namespace *ns2*, the user running the program should be granted the appropriate (*READ*,
*WRITE*, or both) privileges on the fileset. Additionally, the user needs to be granted
appropriate permissions on the HDFS directory that the fileset points to. When
:ref:`impersonation <admin-impersonation>` is used in the program's namespace, this user
is the impersonated user, otherwise it is the user that the CDAP Master runs as.
